### GQnotes:
1. [QuickLink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA)GQ. [Lerarn PyTorch for Deep Learning](https://www.learnpytorch.io/), 
	- Machine learning is to finding patterns from number described many cases (large data set) 
	- AI is bigest set, subset of this is ML, subset of this is DL. 
	- We have Unstructured data (voice analysis), so we need DeepLearning instead of MachineLearning
		- example algorithms are:
			- Neural networks
			- Fully connected neural network
			- Convolutional neural network
			- Recurrent neural network
			- Transformer
			- ...many more
		- first three is the topic of this course (with PyTorch)
	- [ends](https://youtu.be/V_xro1bcAuA?t=1402) at 23:20 speed 2.2x is ok, can be faster
