### GQnotes:
1. [QuickLink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA)GQ. [Lerarn PyTorch for Deep Learning](https://www.learnpytorch.io/), 
	- Machine learning is to finding patterns from number described many cases (large data set) 
	- AI is bigest set, subset of this is ML, subset of this is DL. 
	- We have Unstructured data (voice analysis), so we need DeepLearning instead of MachineLearning
		- example algorithms are:
			- Neural networks
			- Fully connected neural network
			- Convolutional neural network
			- Recurrent neural network
			- Transformer
			- ...many more
		- first three is the topic of this course (with PyTorch)
	- [ends](https://youtu.be/V_xro1bcAuA?t=1402) at 23:20 speed 2.2x is ok, can be faster
2. More therory about deep learning
	1. Types of learning: 
		- Supervised
		- Unsupervised & Self-supervised
		- Transfer Learning
	
		 We need first of these three. When we will have a model, we can use third option to improve
		
		Deep Learning Use Cases -> Translation or Speech recognition -> Is called Sequence to sequence, shorter #seq2seq . 
		[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) this page should be visited most. PyTorch is deep learning framework. Is open source and most popular. OpenAI uses  PyTorch.  Is absolutely everywhere. Supports ussage of GPU/TPU. We use tensors as a representation processing data input/output
		- [ends](https://youtu.be/V_xro1bcAuA?t=3835) at 1:03:55 speed 2.2x is ok,
