   ````Answer
Here are the corrections made:

1. Replaced "movie" with "film" to keep the language more international.
2. "the begining of jurney" changed to "the Obsidian software journey" for clarity.
3. "ich" was corrected to "it", as it seems like a typo.
4. Replaced "to use that software" with "for motivation", making the sentence more direct and specific about the purpose of watching the video.
