4. Somebody get the same idea and realized it. Maby worth co compare [https://github.com/kotritrona/osumapper](https://github.com/kotritrona/osumapper) 
5. The Youtube about  [Using OpenAI to generate osu! maps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c8V368CbLU) . WORKED: readed comments and check if was something usefull is there:
   Checked: Author: Stop posting "still better than maps by ___ mapper". It's repetitive, stupid, rude, wrong, and you're probably worse at mapping than they are. Q: do I paste the entire .osu file contents into it or..? how do I use this for a low diff on a map? A: Only paste hitobjects, not too much else it can limit the size of the output. If you give it something, you're asking it to make more of that. The difficulty settings and other metadata only appear once in the .osu, so we don't want it creating more. Q2: does this work with mania. A2:  Yes, A3(sarcastic) It would probably work better with mania. Q3: how did you do this it doesnt work for me :( Q4: Where i just put music, And it creates a map from the music Q5: I was also looking for that kind of AI but I guess we're not in that era yet lol.
   Resume: So it probably create map from the moving map object not from the music. 
   6. [Audio Data Processing in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqpSb5p1xQo) This is show how you can deal with audio in Python. Is not so important. You can treat it like fun fact for a morning Coffee
   7. [Types of Audio Features for Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ9u1vUtcIA) Very interesting video cover many aspects crucial to our project. It should be strongly recommended to watch it at the beginning. It seems like a long long series that provides a good picture of audio engineering.
      The topic review confirms that the [CHANNEL](https://www.youtube.com/@ValerioVelardoTheSoundofAI) and course in this course is a good place to start with ML and DL for audio. GQTODO: checking also comunity proposed by this lecturer. 
   9. [Python TensorFlow for Machine Learning – Neural Network Text Classification Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtRLrQ3Ev-U) A good overview of what machine learning looks like. (note: 3.2x speed is undersandable)
	   1. Also course form her: [# Machine Learning for Everybody – Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_LwzRVP7bg) Generally is a good point of understanding for data science. But we need some more sound directed ML
