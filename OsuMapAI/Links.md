5. The Youtube about  [Using OpenAI to generate osu! maps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c8V368CbLU) . WORKED: readed comments and check if was something usefull is there:
   Checked: Author: Stop posting "still better than maps by ___ mapper". It's repetitive, stupid, rude, wrong, and you're probably worse at mapping than they are. Q: do I paste the entire .osu file contents into it or..? how do I use this for a low diff on a map? A: Only paste hitobjects, not too much else it can limit the size of the output. If you give it something, you're asking it to make more of that. The difficulty settings and other metadata only appear once in the .osu, so we don't want it creating more. Q2: does this work with mania. A2:  Yes, A3(sarcastic) It would probably work better with mania. Q3: how did you do this it doesnt work for me :( Q4: Where i just put music, And it creates a map from the music Q5: I was also looking for that kind of AI but I guess we're not in that era yet lol.
   Resume: So it probably create map from the moving map object not from the music.
